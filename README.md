# 🐶🐱 SVM Image Classification (Cats vs Dogs)

I’m excited to share **Task 03** of my Machine Learning internship at **SkillCraft Technology**!

In this task, I implemented a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model to classify images of **cats** and **dogs** using the popular **Kaggle Cats vs Dogs Dataset**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model that can accurately distinguish between cat and dog images.  
To achieve this, I used:

- Image preprocessing techniques  
- Feature extraction  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier  
- Model evaluation and performance measurement

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- OpenCV / PIL for image handling  

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Dataset Used:** Kaggle Dogs vs Cats Dataset  
- Contains thousands of labeled cat and dog images.

## 🚀 What I Did

### ✔️ Image Loading & Preprocessing
- Resized all images to a common size  
- Converted to grayscale  
- Flattened image arrays for SVM compatibility  

### ✔️ Feature Extraction
- Transformed pixel data into numerical feature vectors  

### ✔️ Model Building
- Implemented an **SVM classifier**  
- Trained the model on extracted features  
- Tuned hyperparameters to increase accuracy  

### ✔️ Model Evaluation
- Calculated accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix  
- Visualized sample predictions

## 🧩 Conclusion

This task helped me understand:
- How to preprocess image datasets  
- How classical ML models handle image data  
- Practical implementation of SVM for classification tasks  

It was a great hands-on experience working with real image data!
